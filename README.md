# README

Not enough people live by their principles, but mostly because they don't know what their principles are. This document serves as an attempt for me to discover and live by my own principles, and document them publicly. This document is a living repository of the beliefs, principles, and actions of Milosz Kowal. It is designed to keep track of changes in thinking patterns, beliefs, and actions, and have them be publicly available. Proceed at your own risk. If you are Milosz:

* Develop a habit of using the Codex as a repository for beliefs that develop throughout the year.
* Consider doing a monthly review of whether my life is in alignment with values and beliefs. If not, should my behavior change or have my understanding and values changed.
* Do a yearly review in January of the entire document, editing places where beliefs have changed. Expect beliefs and tactics to change, don't hold on to them too rigidly.

If you are not Milosz:

* Read this with the understanding that you are different than Milosz; the way he lives his life is not the way you should live yours.
* Consider creating your own Codex Vitae. Feel free to copy anything here that is helpful.
