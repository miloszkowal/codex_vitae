# Codex Vitae

I’m trying something new this year. I believe that not enough people live by their principles, so I’m taking the time to live by my own. This document is meant to be a repository of these principles, sort of as a public record, so that I can be held accountable. I have been working on this for some time now, and the start of the new year is a decent time to publish. The kinks, particularly with the publishing aspect of it, are still to be worked out, but this is for now.---This document is a living repository of the beliefs, principles, and actions of Milosz Kowal. It is designed to keep track of changes in thinking patterns, beliefs, and actions, and have them be publicly available. Proceed at your own risk.If you are Milosz:

* Develop a habit of using the Codex as a repository for beliefs that develop throughout the year.
* Consider doing a monthly review of whether my life is in alignment with values and beliefs. If not, should my behavior change or have my understanding and values changed.
* Do a yearly review in January of the entire document, editing places where beliefs have changed. Expect beliefs and tactics to change, don't hold on to them too rigidly.

If you are not Milosz:

* Read this with the understanding that you are different than Milosz; the way he lives his life is not the way you should live yours.
* Consider creating your own Codex Vitae. Feel free to copy anything here that is helpful.

### In General

#### Meta-beliefs

* Beliefs are subject to change. It is important to maintain an open mind to differing perspectives and admitting when one's own views and principles are incorrect or flawed.

Personal Principles

* I will say what I mean and mean what I say
* I will be punctual
* I will complete all tasks to the best of my ability
* I will only take on assignments that align with my personal beliefs; everything else will be discarded
* I will be the change I want to see in the world

### Self-care

#### Productivity

* Productivity is not just a state of being, it is a philosophy.
* Productivity can be acquired through training.
* Productivity is defined as a deliberate action towards goals.
* True productivity is only achieved with an end goal in mind. Anything else is busywork.

#### Food

* Most food today is meant to be enjoyed with pleasure in mind, rather than fuel.
* Empty calories found in candy and burgers are causing a decline in overall health of the average American.
* It is in the best interest of fast food companies to keep their own prices down while maintaining high prices of healthy food. This does NOT necessarily imply a conspiracy by "Big McDonald's."
* Education about food plays a pivotal role in the potential for change. The more we educate the populace, the more positive results we will see.
* Drinking water is more important than eating food.
* Most people don't drink enough water.

#### Physical Fitness

* "No man has the right to be an amateur in the matter of physical training. It is a shame for a man to grow old without seeing the beauty and strength of which his body is capable." - Socrates
* Train and grind every day. Don't let yourself get lazy and complacent with your body or weight. There are always things to be improved upon, whether it's lifting larger weight, a faster mile, or a longer run.
* Physical fitness is inextricably linked to mental and emotional wellness, as well as productivity and energy levels.

#### Mental / Emotional Wellness

* Journaling is pivotal to maintaining a clear mind.
* Meditation is important to maintaining focus. This does not imply any connection to religious dogma.
* Most mental illness can be alleviated with therapy rather than medication.
* The problems of mental illness in men are largely swept under the rug, and that will soon be a big problem.

#### Relationships

* The biological imperative for relationships is reproduction
* "Casual sex" is an oxymoron
* Relationships don't exist for happiness - they exist for companionship and as a preventative measure against insanity
* Most people are driven by lust instead of by love
* Modern media, especially pornography, skews the perception of what a relationship is

### Material World

#### Abode / Home

I subscribe to the "luxurious minimalism" style of living. That means having few possessions, but the ones that I do have are of high quality and potentially premium price. This applies to all items, ranging from tea kettles to cars.

#### Money

Money is neither something to be pursued nor scorned. It is simply a vehicle for purchasing goods. While money may not buy happiness, it can certainly be used as a tool against sadness. Studies have shown that past a certain point, additional money does not provide additional happiness

#### Consumerism / Capitalism

Capitalism is the primary force driving people out of poverty. It is imperative that people are allowed to trade and work freely wherever they please and whatever they are most suited to doing. Those people need to be compensated for their work in such a manner that allows them to live a sustainable life. I do not support a set minimum wage, as that is detrimental to small businesses on which capitalism thrives. It is the moral imperative of business owners to pay their employees wages commensurate with their output and experience. Those that do not need to be investigated.---

### Work

#### Career / Vocation

To be written.

#### Business

To be written.

#### Learning

As cliche as it sounds, learning never ends. While traditional schooling ends for most people, we are constantly given the opportunity to learn new things. The only thing that might change is whether or not we're open to learning. This involves reading \(and reading A LOT\), having conversations with people of differing opinions, and reflecting.

#### Passion Projects

To be written.

### Philosophies

#### Morality

* People are inherently apathetic - this primes people to be evil
* All drugs should be decriminalized
* Abortion should be legal, but not free
* Gay marriage should be legal as a civil union

#### Family

* The nuclear family is the building block of civilization
* Problems in inner cities can be linked to single-family households and lack of a father figure - this does imply that lack of fathers is the only reason
* Children need both a mother figure and a father figure in their lives to be successful in life
* Parents should only have children voluntarily and when they know they can afford them

#### Society

To be written.

#### Politics

* Socialism doesn't work. It never has and it never will. Look at Venezuela
* People need to be able to peacefully protest against government
* Free speech is paramount to a civilization's success
* Democracies work. They're not perfect, but it's the best we have at this point.

### Predictions

#### By 2020

* Donald Trump will win the presidential election. Again.
