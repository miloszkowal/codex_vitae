### In General

#### Meta-beliefs

* Beliefs are subject to change. It is important to maintain an open mind to differing perspectives and admitting when one's own views and principles are incorrect or flawed.

Personal Principles

* I will do everything with intentionality.
* I will say what I mean and mean what I say.
* I will be punctual.
* I will complete all tasks to the best of my ability.
* I will only take on assignments that align with my personal beliefs; everything else will be discarded.
* I will be the change I want to see in the world.

### Self-care

#### Productivity

* Productivity is not just a state of being, it is a philosophy.
* Productivity can be acquired through training.
* Productivity is defined as a deliberate action towards goals.
* True productivity is only achieved with an end goal in mind. Anything else is busywork.
* Being hyperproductive can lead to burnout and take away from the things that matter the most.

#### Food

* Most food today is meant to be enjoyed with pleasure in mind, rather than fuel.
* Empty calories found in candy and burgers are causing a decline in overall health of the average American.
* It is in the best interest of fast food companies to keep their own prices down while maintaining high prices of healthy food. This does NOT necessarily imply a conspiracy by "Big McDonald's."
* Education about food plays a pivotal role in the potential for change. The more we educate the populace, the more positive results we will see.
* Drinking water is more important than eating food.
* Most people don't drink enough water.

#### Physical Fitness

* Be a good athlete. Learn your physical limits and strive to push past them.
* "No man has the right to be an amateur in the matter of physical training. It is a shame for a man to grow old without seeing the beauty and strength of which his body is capable." - Socrates
* Train and grind every day. Don't let yourself get lazy and complacent with your body or weight. There are always things to be improved upon, whether it's lifting larger weight, a faster mile, or a longer distance.
* Physical fitness is inextricably linked to mental and emotional wellness.

#### Mental / Emotional Wellness

* Journaling is pivotal to maintaining a clear mind.
* Meditation is important to maintaining focus. This does not imply any connection to religious dogma.
* Most mental illness can be alleviated with therapy rather than medication.
* The problems of mental illness in men are largely swept under the rug, and that will soon be a big problem.
* Seek to cultivate silence and learn to live in stillness.

#### Relationships

Be a good son. Honor your parents and your parentage. Be proud of where you came from and don't hide it. Being a son doesn't mean just of your parents, but also of your country.

Be a good lover. When you love someone, act that way. Tell that person you love her, tell her you're proud of her. Be such that you bring out the best in her.

* The biological imperative for relationships is reproduction
* "Casual sex" is an oxymoron
* Relationships don't exist for happiness - they exist for companionship and as a preventative measure against insanity
* Most people are driven by lust instead of by love
* Modern media, especially pornography, skews the perception of what a relationship is
* Most people pine for a relationship, whether they admit to it or not is irrelevant.

### Material World

#### Abode / Home

Own things that exemplify your own personal tastes. Making aesthetic decisions brings you closer to the Kingdom of God, so do not purchase anything for your home unless it has a connection to the divine in some way. This applies to everything, from tea kettles to furniture to homes themselves.

Do not buy more than you need, and try to maximize what you have such that you get your money's worth out of it.

Be aware of what you have. Do not buy things for the sake of buying things. Too many families rent storage because they have too much junk. Do not let yourself get to that point.

#### Money

Money is neither something to be pursued nor scorned. It is simply a vehicle for purchasing goods. While money may not buy happiness, it can certainly be used as a tool against sadness.

Save money and do not squander it needlessly. Always prioritize saving over entertainment expenditures. Make a budget and stick to it.

That being said, budget for entertainment. It is important to enjoy everything life has to offer. Do not turn into a Scrooge.

#### Consumerism / Capitalism

Capitalism is the primary force driving people out of poverty. It is imperative that people are allowed to trade and work freely wherever they please and whatever they are most suited to doing. Those people need to be compensated for their work in such a manner that allows them to live a sustainable life. I do not support a set minimum wage, as that is detrimental to small businesses on which capitalism thrives. It is the moral imperative of business owners to pay their employees wages commensurate with their output and experience. Those that do not need to be investigated.

### Work

#### Career / Vocation

Be a good employee; don't pilfer time or goods when they're not given to you. do not ask for more than you've earned.

Strive to earning as much as possible (Note: This is under review. More money does not equate more happiness.)

Do the work because you're good at it and no one else can do it, not because it's a paycheck. Act so that you can take pride in your work and are confident in talking about it with friends.

Don't work for companies from whom you'd never buy the product. For example, don't work for an ad agency if you don't like ads.


#### Learning

As cliche as it sounds, learning never ends. While traditional schooling ends for most people, we are constantly given the opportunity to learn new things. The only thing that might change is whether or not we're open to learning. This involves reading a lot, having conversations with people of differing opinions, and reflecting.

#### Passion Projects

Ideas have to be discovered, and that discovery occurs through work. Take some time every day to bring yourself further to your goals, whether that means writing, coding, reading.

### Philosophies

#### Morality

* People are inherently apathetic - this primes people to be evil
* All drugs should be decriminalized
* Abortion should be legal, but not free
* Gay marriage should be legal as a civil union

#### Family

* The nuclear family is the building block of civilization
* Problems in inner cities can be linked to single-family households and lack of a father figure - this does imply that lack of fathers is the only reason
* Children need both a mother figure and a father figure in their lives to be successful in life
* Parents should only have children voluntarily and when they know they can afford them

#### Society

* Society is simply a collection of individuals. All policies should go down to the level of the individual as opposed to the level of the group.

#### Politics

* Socialism doesn't work. It never has and it never will.
* People need to be able to peacefully protest against government
* Free speech is paramount to a civilization's success
* Free speech is absolute - "hate speech" is free speech
  * This does not mean that the author condones or agrees with hateful remarks
* Democracies work. They're not perfect, but it's the best we have at this point.
