# Codex Vitae - A Book of Beliefs and Principles

This document is a living repository of the beliefs, principles, and actions of Milosz Kowal. It is designed to keep track of changes in thinking patterns, beliefs, and actions, and have them be publicly available. Proceed at your own risk.

If you _are_ Milosz:

* Develop a habit of using the Codex as a repository for beliefs that develop throughout the year.
* Consider doing a monthly review of whether my life is in alignment with values and beliefs. If not, should my behavior change or have my understanding and values changed.
* Do a yearly review in January of the entire document, editing places where beliefs have changed. Expect beliefs and tactics to change — don’t hold on to them too rigidly.

If you _are not_ Milosz:

* Read this with the understanding that you are different than Milosz — the way he lives his life is not the way you should live yours.
* Consider creating your own Codex Vitae. Feel free to copy anything here that is helpful.

# Material World

## Abode / Home

I subscribe to the "luxurious minimalism" style of living. That means having few possessions, but the ones that I do have are of high quality and potentially premium price. This applies to all items, ranging from tea kettles to cars.

## Money

## Consumerism / Capitalism

Capitalism is the primary force driving people out of poverty. It is imperative that people are allowed to trade and work freely wherever they please and whatever they are most suited to doing. Those people need to be compensated for their work in such a manner that allows them to live a sustainable life. I do not support a set minimum wage, as that is detrimental to small businesses on which capitalism thrives. It is the moral imperative of business owners to pay their employees wages commensurate with their output and experience. Those that do not need to be investigated.
